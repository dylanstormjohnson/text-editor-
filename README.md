# text-editor-

A text editor that runs in the browser!!

## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js. I was motivated to build this project so that I could learn more about PWA's. It was built because there is value in knowing how to create a downloadable website. It is intended to solve the problem of not being able to store text-based information via a downloaded application. In making said project, I learned more about PWA's and how to troubleshoot them.
